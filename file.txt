I didn’t know where Rhys, Cassian, and Azriel had been waiting, but
when Mrs. Laurent had hauled herself into the carriage crammed with
the last of the staff, heading down to the village to catch transportation
to wherever they all had family, there was a knock on the door.

The light was already fading, and the world outside was thick with

shades of blue and white and Stay, stained golden as I opened the front
door and found them waiting,

Nesta and Elain were in the large dining room—the most open space
in the house.
